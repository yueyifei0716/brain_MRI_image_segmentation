# Brain_MRI_image_segmentation

- Implemented a convolutional network for brain MRI image segmentation using TensorFlow, incorporating ideas from UNet, Attention-based UNet, and Deep Residual UNet.
- Trained and evaluated models on an augmented dataset of 4000 images, achieving IoU scores of around 0.99 and Dice coefficients of around 0.7.
